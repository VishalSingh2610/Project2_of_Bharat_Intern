House Price Prediction Using different algorithms

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 12 attributes of different Houses. Each row represents a house sample, and the columns represent different features of the house type. Here's a breakdown of the attributes in the dataset:
1. MSSubClass: This feature represents the building class category of the house. It is a categorical variable indicating the type of dwelling involved in the sale. Examples of subclasses include 1-story 1946 & newer all styles, 2-story 1946 & newer, etc.
2. MSZoning: This feature represents the general zoning classification of the property. It is also a categorical variable and specifies how the property is legally allowed to be used. Examples include residential low density (RL), residential medium density (RM), commercial (C), etc.
3. LotArea: This feature represents the total area of the land on which the house is built. It is a numeric variable, typically measured in square feet or square meters.
4. LotConfig: This feature describes the configuration of the lot where the house is located. It is a categorical variable that can take values like inside lot, corner lot, cul-de-sac, etc.
5. BldgType: This feature indicates the type of dwelling. It is a categorical variable that can take values such as 1-family detached, 2-family conversion, townhouse inside unit, etc.
6. OverallCond: This feature provides a rating of the overall condition of the house. It is a numeric variable typically ranging from 1 to 10, where 1 represents very poor condition and 10 represents excellent condition.
7. YearBuilt: This feature denotes the year the house was originally constructed. It is a numeric variable.
8. YearRemodAdd: This feature denotes the year the house was remodeled or had significant renovations. It is a numeric variable.
9. Exterior1st: This feature represents the exterior covering material of the house. It is a categorical variable and can take values like vinyl siding, brick veneer, etc.
10. BsmtFinSF2: This feature represents the finished square footage of the basement area (type 2). It is a numeric variable.
11. TotalBsmtSF: This feature represents the total finished square footage of the basement area. It is a numeric variable.
12. SalePrice: This is the target variable and represents the sale price of the house. It is a numeric variable, and the goal of the house price prediction model is to predict this value based on the other features.
